                    <p>As you can see I was inspired by those three Gods, and I was espetially attracted by the principle they incarnate. 
                        I stated earlier that the KEG logo, has a profound meaning, and this is what we wanted that logo to represent, 
                        something deep and profound. You may have also noticed that the logo looks like a globe or a circle, and it's indeed a globe, 
                        the KEG logo represent The Rising Sun of Wisdom, Spreading Love and Fortune.
                         It is quit strang to realize that I found inspiration in my own names.</p>
